# Django + Vercel

This example shows how to use Django 4 on Vercel with Serverless Functions using the [Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).

## Demo

https://django-template.vercel.app/

## How it Works

Our Django application, `example` is configured as an installed application in `vercel_app/settings.py`:

```python
# vercel_app/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'example',
]
```

There is a single view which renders the current time in `example/views.py`:

```python
# example/views.py
from datetime import datetime

from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    now = datetime.now()
    html = f'''
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello from Vercel!</h1>
            <p>The current time is { now }.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    '''
    return HttpResponse(html)
```

This view is exposed a URL through `example/urls.py`:

```python
# example/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from example.views import index


urlpatterns = [
    path('', index),
]
```

Finally, it's made accessible to the Django server inside `vercel_app/urls.py`:

```python
# vercel_app/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('', include('example.urls')),
]
```

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Django to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

## Running Locally

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your Django application is now available at `http://localhost:8000`.
